Algorithm selection like industry ML teams

## Dataset ##
Breast Cancer

## Actions Performed ##
1. Choose a dataset and apply necessary preprocessing steps once.
2. Split into train-test sets and keep the same split for all models.
3. Train multiple models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM.
4. Predict test results for all models.
5. Evaluate each model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
6. Store all metric values in a Pandas comparison table.
7. Plot bar chart comparing performance across models.
8. Identify which model generalizes best by comparing train vs test scores.
9. Select best model based on business requirement and save it.
